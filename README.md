## 05-Day_Planner



# Task:
1.) Create a day-time calender application that allows for input of events to be saved to the local storage and and provide that calender and the events after the page is refreshed.

2.) When the page is opened the a calender title and the current date are displayed in the middle of the page.

3.) The time block provides the traditional time period of 9am-5pm business hours.

4.) Each one hour block of time is color depending on if the time block is in the past, present, or future in relation to the current time.

5.)The time block should allow for an event to be added in the form of text and then saved to the local storage.

6.)When the page is refreshed the event should still be saved in the time block it was writen.

# Result:
This assignment allowed for the use and practise of the "moment" from the JS library.

This allowed us to parse and validate the current time and use the current time to draw comparisons to other possible time, weather it was past, present or future.

Once again we a able to practise and put into play the setting and getting items/data from local storage. 

Finally being able to work with the DOM to call out specific tags, classes, and ids was nessesary.
